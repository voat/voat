        <h1>A quick introduction to WhoaVerse</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
            So, what is WhoaVerse? Whoaverse is a website about <b>everything</b> where stories are created by its users.<br />
            What makes whoaverse so great is that users can vote and decide which content gets to reach the frontpage.<br /><br />
            We don't censor content (unless it is illegal) and we don't let anyone "game" the voting system.
        </p>
        <h1>Do I have to register?</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
            You can use whoaverse without registering, just jump right in and start exploring.<br />
            You can start browsing <a href="/subverses">existing subverses</a> right away.<br />
            As a guest, you will not be able to vote, comment or submit new links and stories, however. This is solely in order to prevent spam.
        </p>
        <h1>How can I become an active member?</h1>
        <div class="circle-step">1</div>
        <div style="display: inline-block;">
            <p class="intro-text">
                Start by <a href="/Account/Register">registering a free account</a>, (no e-mail adress needed) if you want to participate in voting or if you want to submit new stories or comments.

                Once you are logged in, you can start submitting new <a href="/submit">stories</a>, <a href="/submit?linkpost=true">links</a> and comments or vote on existing comments and submissions.
            </p>

        <h1>Does it cost anything?</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
            Whoaverse is and always will be free.<br />
            We earn money through donations and unobtrusive advertizing.
        </p>
        <h1>What makes whoaverse different from other similar comunities? Privacy!</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
            Unlike many other popular comunities, we go a step further to safeguard our users privacy.<br />
            For example, if you delete your reddit account, the content of your comments and submissions do not get deleted.<sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/1dhw2j/reddits_privacy_policy_has_been_rewritten_from/c9qgbbb"><span>[</span>source<span>]</span></a></sup><br /><br />
            At whoaverse, when you delete your account (which you can do at any time), this will automatically do the following:<br /><br />
            - all text submissions you ever made with this account will be overwritten with "deleted"<br />
            - all link submissions you made will be overwritten with "deleted" and the url will be overwritten to http://whoaverse.com<br />
            - your entire comment and submission voting history will be deleted<br />
