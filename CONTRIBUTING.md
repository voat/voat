# Contributing to Voat

We use [git-flow branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"). 

## Git-flow concept summary

#### Development branch
All new feature development and bug fixes occurs in **develop** branch. This is our main development branch where all changes planned for the next release are placed. We accept direct commits to this branch when it comes to small changes.

#### Feature branches
If you would like to contribute a new feature or work on something non-trivial, you should create a feature branch. Once your work is complete, the changes can be merged into development branch where they will wait for the next release.

#### Hotfix branches
We use hotfix branches for patches of the latest release. Hotfix branches are merged both into the master and development branches.
