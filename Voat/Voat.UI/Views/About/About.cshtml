        <h1>What is Voat?</h1>
        <p>
            Voat™ (pronounced voat as in goat) officially launched in April 2014 as a media aggregator website featuring user-posted content.
        </p>
        <p>
            Voat initially started as a hobby project by a third year BSc student in Lund, Sweden. Due to the recent interest generated by the online community, this has evolved from hobby into full-fledged desire to create the website that will become the place where you can "have your say™"
        </p>
        <p>
            No legal subject in this universe should be out of bounds. Our aim is to build a site that serves the needs and wants of our users; one that strives for quality over quantity, and doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator in return for traffic.
        </p>
        <h1>What's a media aggregator?</h1>
        <p>
            <b>Aggregator</b> refers to a web site or computer software that brings together  a specific type of information from multiple online sources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Users can submit any type of legal content, questions, videos and commentary. Voat's job is to amalgamate all of this into a logical universe of internet things, so you can quickly find what interests you.
        </p>
        <h1>So why create this site?</h1>
        <p>
            We're driven by the desire for an aggregator website that goes back to the days of quality content and friendly atmosphere. Like many others, we found other media aggregator sites lacking in features and usability and knew we could improve. There are so many amazing ideas out there in the community, yet those who can implement these ideas don't seem to be listening. We thought we'd help them along.
        </p>
        <p>
            There's no doubt we can build a better home for those of us that enjoy aggregated content, if we simply listen to those that use it, and hold that as an ongoing priority.
        </p>
        <h1>How are you any different from those other sites?</h1>
        <p>
            To put it simply, we are user and privacy focused, and will go to great lengths to ensure there's transparency around these type of decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Privacy? That's right, Voat aims to exceed expectations with regard to privacy. For example, one of the first features we implemented was the ability for our users to completely delete their accounts and associated data. That means with one click and a few ticks, all comments posted, all voting history and all personal submissions deleted. This is just the beginning, and we are open to feedback on how to take this further.  We are still working on our updated privacy policy and look forward to releasing it in the coming weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have a multitude of ideas in the works and are listening to what our users want. There will be features geared toward user customization and their experience that mirrors no other aggregator site. Our focus is on including what does work and throwing away what doesn't. Stay tuned!
        </p>
        <h1>Hey... you look like that other site!</h1>
        <p>
            All cars have four wheels. Does that mean that every car is the same?
        </p>
        <h1>Did you just copy/paste the source code of that other website?</h1>
        <p>
            Voat source code (apart from third party libraries listed below) has been written from scratch in a programming language called C#. That other website is written in an entirely different programming language. Did we just port their code? Not at all. We use entirely different architecture and what you are looking at right now is the result of hard work of several dedicated people over a period of nearly two years.
        </p>
        <h1>Who's the team behind this?</h1>
        <p>
            We are two students currently studying Computer Science and Economics at University of Zurich in Switzerland and we are looking to expand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Atif (/u/Atko) is the original creator and brains behind the website. He manages all aspects of the technical implementation and big-picture vision, currently concerning himself with ensuring the website is fully functional and constantly being improved.
        </p>
        <h1>What will you do with my data?</h1>
        <p>
            We will <i>never</i> sell it. That's something we're completely against in principle, and this will not change.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will use traffic metrics and meta-data to improve the site, but will not retain any identifiable data. We are personally interested in how our site is used by its visitors, simply so we know where to improve and what is successful. Besides this we have very little interest in your data.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any data we do retain can always be deleted on request (via an automatic process).
        </p>
        <h1>Will you run ads, how will you pay for server costs?</h1>
        <p>
            Our true costs are still being realized and we do wish for this site to be self-sustaining at the very least.  There are currently a multitude of ideas being discussed. Current examples revolve around creating a donate button which will be used only for website/server costs, we may bring in unobtrusive ads that are relevant and chosen by the owners and users of their own subs, and we will probably sell merchandise and do our part for the "T-Shirt Economy". Our other revenue ideas, which we believe our users will get a kick out of, will be shared as soon as we are ready for launch.
        </p>
        <h1>How can I help?</h1>
        <p>
            We sincerely appreciate all the help we receive. Spread the word. Send us your feedback. Interact with the community. Post high quality content.
        </p>
        <p>
