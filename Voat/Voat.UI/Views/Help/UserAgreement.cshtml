        </p>

        <h1>Moderators</h1>
        <p>
            Moderating a subverse is an unofficial, voluntary position. We reserve the right to revoke that position for any user at any time.
            You may not perform moderation actions in return for any form of compensation or favor from third-parties.
            When you receive notice that there is content that violates this user agreement on subverses you moderate, you agree to remove it.

        <h1>Spam</h1>

        </p>

        <h1>Indemnity</h1>
        <p>
            All the things you do and all the information you submit or post to voat remain your responsibility. Indemnity is basically a way of saying that you will not hold us legally liable for any of your user content or actions that infringe the law or the rights of a third party or person in any way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifically, you agree to hold voat, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, and third party service providers harmless from and defend them against any claims, costs, damages, losses, expenses, and any other liabilities, including attorneys’ fees and costs, arising out of or related to your access to or use of voat, your violation of this user agreement, and/or your violation of the rights of any third party or person.
        </p>

        <h1>Disclaimer of warranties</h1>
        <p>
            voat is provided "as is" and without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, we and our affiliates and third party service providers disclaim any and all warranties, express or implied,
            including (but not limited to) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement of proprietary rights, or any other warranty, condition, guarantee or representation, whether oral or electronic.
            You are solely responsible for any damage to your computer or mobile device, loss of use, or loss of your user content.

            We will not be liable for any special, consequential, indirect, incidental, punitive, reliance, or exemplary damages, whether in tort, contract, or any other legal theory,
            arising out of or in any way connected with this agreement or your use of or attempt to use voat, including (but not limited to) damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, or data.
            This limitation on liability shall not be affected even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.
            Some states do not allow for the exclusion of implied warranties or the limitation or exclusion of liability for incidental or consequential damages, so the above exclusions may not apply to you.
            You may have other rights that vary from state to state.
        </p>
        <p>
            You agree to release us, our affiliates, and third-party service providers, and each associated director, employee, agents, and officers, from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential), of every kind and nature, known and unknown, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected to your use of voat.
