        <h1>How can I enable night mode and customize my profile?</h1>
        <p>
            You can use your <a href="/account/manage">account management page</a> to enable night-mode, add a profile photo or avatar, write a short bio and further personalize your account.
        </p>
        <h1>Can I submit links to sites I operate?</h1>
        <p>
            Submitting only links to sites you operate (or are associated with), without submitting other, unrelated links, is considered spamming. If you submit niche content (for example gaming videos from your own YouTube channel), you should create your own subverse and submit the content only to that subverse.
            If majority of the links you submit are to sites you are associated with, your domains may be globally banned from Voat. To be on the safe side, if you submit 10 links to various subverses on Voat, at most 2 of the 10 submitted links may be to the sites you are associated with.
        </p>
        <h1>Can I submit links to any subverse I want?</h1>
        <p>
            Each subverse has its own rules which are stated in respective subverse sidebars. If you ignore said rules, your account may be banned from submitting further content to the subverse or in some cases, globally.
        </p>
        <h1>Can I register subverses and not use them?</h1>
        <p>
            We have multiple automated mechanisms in place which purge unused subverses. As soon as you register your subverse, you should submit at least one post and edit the sidebar.
            If you abandon your subverse, you may lose it if someone else requests to take it over.
        </p>
        <h1>When is a sub considered inactive/abandoned?</h1>
        <p>
            While Voat is in alpha, we will be freeing up unused/inactive subs by deleting them or transferring them to users who submit a subverse transfer request in <a href="/v/subverserequest">/v/subverserequest</a>.
            As a subverse owner, at least once a month, you should start at least one discussion in your sub, or submit at least one link to your sub. Furthermore, at least once a month, you should submit at least one comment to a discussion/link posted in your sub. If you fail to do anything of the above, your sub will be considered as abandoned/inactive and it may be deleted or transferred to another user which makes a request in <a href="/v/subverserequest">/v/subverserequest</a>.
        </p>
        <h1>Will you censor comments and submissions?</h1>
        <p>
            While we don't necessarily approve or agree with all content that users submit to Voat, our policy is to not meddle and not censor content unless said content is illegal in Switzerland.
        </p>
        <h1>I forgot my password. Can you reset it for me?</h1>
        <p>
            Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do to help you reset your password.
        </p>
        <h1>I wanted to register a subverse, but it is already registered and it looks abandoned. Can I take it over?</h1>
        <p>
            In most cases, yes. You can request to "adopt a subverse" by submitting a post to <a href="/v/subverserequest">/v/subverserequest</a>.
        </p>
        <h1>I am a developer, how can I contribute to Voat?</h1>
        <p>
            You can join us on <a href="/v/voatdev">/v/voatdev</a> and you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/voat/voat/issues">open issues</a> on GitHub.
            We are always on the lookout for dedicated developers and if we like your contributions, we may offer you equity and a position at Voat.
        </p>
